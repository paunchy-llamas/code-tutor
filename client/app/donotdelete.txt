Recipe:
How to show an element only if the user is logged in.

////////////////// 1) $rootScope //////////////////
$rootScope is the parent of all $scope objects
It's best practice to avoid using it, usually, but this is a good use case
because a lot of pages are going to want to know if a user is logged in or not.

I put a .run inside app.js where $rootScope.loggedIn = false
I don't know much about .run except it's often used to get an application going.

When a user logs in, set $rootScope.loggedIn = true
And in the function handling logout, similarly set $rootScope.loggedIn = false
DO NOT name any local scope variable 'loggedIn'

////////////////// 2) localStorage / tokens //////////////////
Auth is set up to check if localStorage has a 'com.codeLlama' property before
any http request is sent. The only 'logic' necessary to log out a user is to remove
that item from local storage.

Example code: $window.localStorage.removeItem('com.codeLlama') & .getItem('com.codeLlama')

And temporarily, while you're testing, you can store the token in some temp variable:
$scope.temp = (result of getItem) and later use .setItem('com.codeLlama', $scope.temp)
to fake a log-in without having to go back to localhost:8000/#/login

////////////////// 3) ng-show & ng-hide //////////////////
Example code:
  <p ng-hide='loggedIn'>Displayed only when the user is logged in.</p>

A couple of things:
1) ng-hide and hg-show are set equal to some variable that must be a Boolean true/false.
Only if that Boolean is true will the DOM element render.
2) If 'loggedIn' is not found in the current scope (and it better not be!),
Angular looks up to $rootScope

////////////////// Notes: //////////////////
- You need to pass in $rootScope to any controller trying to change $rootScope.loggedIn
- We planned to have 'become a tutor' show up in the nav bar is logged in, which can now
be easily done. However we also planned to show 'update your profile' if the user is
logged in AND a tutor, which will require some additional logic.
